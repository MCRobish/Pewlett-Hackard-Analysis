# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to take a set of several csv files containing HR data from an imaginary company. The target was to determine the number of employees retiring per title in the company, as well as identify some employees that are eligible in a mentorship program. The goal is to begin training early in order to prevent significant knowledge loss and staffing issues as these individuals retire. 

## Results:

**Deliverable 1: Determining the Titles Eligible for Retirement**

* The definition of employees that are "at risk" of retiring was for employees with birth dates from 1952-1955. The _retirement_titles.csv_ file gives the employee number, names, titles and the dates those titles were help for all employees within that range of birth dates. However, that dataset is limited because some employees have received promotions and title changes throughout their careers, resulting in duplicate records.
